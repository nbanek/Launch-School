// Another real-world example of XOR is a dry-room, which is connected by a small chamber, connected to a hallway.
// A person cannot enter with both doors shut, they can pass through to the chamber
// when one door is open, but cannot open both doors at the same time.
// It's either one door open or the other, not both.


// XOR cannot be short circuit because both operands are required to get the result.
